# meal-app

This is a personal project I started because meal planning is a repeatetive process and can be made much more effective and simple. I spent a lot of time in checking the ingredients available at home, then making a weekly plan, then sharing it with my partner, and then finally making a grocery list. And not to mention how often I ran out of ideas to come with new or different meals. 

This is why I am working on meal-app. It is a weekly meal scheduling app that helps users build meal plans of their choice. Users can choose the meals they want to eat from a repository of meals - from Vegan to Indian, South Asian, Mediteranian, Turkish or many more recipes. Users can also add their own recipes from a blog post into the app in order to build a 7 day meal plan every week. Users can see their past meal plans, and be able to re-select the recipes for a new plan. Once a recipe is added or selected in the meal plan, you can see all the ingredients listed there which makes it into a ready to use grocery purchase list. Thus, helping users saving time in purchasing groceries and meal prepping.
